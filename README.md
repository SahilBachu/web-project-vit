## About The Project

This repository contains the source code for a simple, minimalist personal portfolio website. It was developed as a mini-project requirement for the Web Programming course at VIT.

The primary goal of this project was to apply fundamental concepts of web development using **ReactJS**. It demonstrates the use of:

*   React Components (functional components)
*   JSX for structuring UI
*   React State (`useState` hook) for managing component data
*   React Props for passing data between components
*   Basic Forms with various input types (text, checkboxes, radio buttons, select, textarea)
*   Event Handling (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.)
*   Basic CSS for styling (using an external stylesheet)

### Pages Included:

The portfolio website features the following sections:

1.  **Home:** A brief introduction about me.
2.  **Skills:** A showcase of technical skills relevant to web development.
3.  **Socials:** Links to connect via social media or professional platforms.
4.  **Contact:** A functional contact form for inquiries.

## Technologies Used

*   **ReactJS:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core programming language for logic and interactivity.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the application with a modern theme.
*   **HTML5:** Structure defined within JSX.
*   **Git & GitHub:** For version control and code hosting.
